/* TODO
 * Listen for a particular signal, and checkpoint & gracefully shut down,
 * printing out our best found solution(s) so far.
 *
 * If Torque:
 * Suggest that the user make use of the signal resource (requested with -l
 * as with walltime, etc).  From the Torque documentation:
 *
 *   signal=<signal>@<# of seconds> : will ask Torque to send the signal
 *   <signal> to the running job <# of seconds> before it reaches the walltime
 *   limit. This option is useful only for programs that can do checkpointing.
 * 
 * If SLURM:
 * SLURM has the option "--signal", which works in the same way.
 *
 * It seems that a lot of established applications with support for
 * checkpointing use this method to determine when they should checkpoint and
 * stop.
 *
 * We need to pick a signal.  Possibly SIGTERM, which is by default sent a
 * few moments before SIGKILL, but the delay is unlikely to be long enough
 * by default.  Something like SIGQUIT is a better idea.  At this point,
 * with the top500 list being 96% Linux, we probably don't have to worry
 * about BSD or AIX signals, at least not yet.

/* TODO
 * How big will our SQLite DB get, if we're storing the information about all
 * our particles/searches at each time step?
 * Is it impractical?  Can we make sure that there is the option of writing
 * the data to, say, /dev/shm and then copying it to somewhere more permanent
 * when we do a formal checkpoint?  The checkpoint itself would then be
 * a case of duplicating the SQLite DB to somewhere else.
 *
 * Alaric, who used SQLite at Rainstor as the metadata storage for their
 * rather larger, distributed RDBMS, thinks that my proposed abuse will work
 * quite well with SQLite.  Even with one huge table, it should be fine.
 *
 * Back of the envelope calculations by both him and JHD suggest that space
 * won't be a big problem, but we can always prune a bit during the run if
 * need be.  Perhaps making that an option (or not pruning could be the
 * option) for the user would be a good thing.
